# hello-world

Well, It is my first time trying to do some coding, and hopefully coding will treat me nicer!
I ve recently tried to make some changes for myself
as 2018 appraoches, I am about to leave America and go back to my country
with my boyfriend
It is great that time I spend in the past 2 years taught me how to live a life
And it is awesome!
